# eBaySellerLocationFork
This is a patched fork of the abandoned "eBay Seller Location" userscript: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/410587-ebay-seller-location  

It displays the location of the eBay seller on eBay product pages (in the info box on the right) and on search results.

Can be installed in your browser using a userscript addon such as Violentmonkey: https://violentmonkey.github.io/
