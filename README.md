This is a patched fork of the abandoned "eBay Seller Location" script: 
https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/410587-ebay-seller-location

It displays the location of the eBay seller on eBay product pages (in the info box on the right) and on search results.

GitHub repository: https://github.com/sonofevil/eBaySellerLocationFork

Changes to the original script (v0.1):

v1.0
- Optimized code.
- Various fixes.
- Updated selectors.
- Now works on search results internationally.
- Added delay to search results loop to prevent rate limiting.

v0.4
- I don't remember.

v0.3
- Script now also works on search results.

v0.2
- Updated info box selector in line 34 to reflect changes to eBay site code.
- Updated item-id selector in line 24 to reflect changes to eBay site code.
- Changed url scope to hopefully cover all regional eBay domains.
